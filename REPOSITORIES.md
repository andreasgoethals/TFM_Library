# Repositories — context corpus

This folder is a **read-only** reference corpus. Every `.txt` file
here is a flat dump of an upstream repository or webpage, kept
locally so the pipeline code can be grepped against canonical
implementations without round-tripping to the internet. **Never edit
these files.** If a snapshot is stale, replace the whole file with a
fresh dump using the same filename, so existing greps in the
codebase keep working.

Listed alphabetically below. Where a repo corresponds to a paper in
[`papers/`](papers/), the paper is linked. Where the file is a
fresh dump of a public GitHub repo, the upstream URL is linked.

## `Huggingface TabPFN.txt`

**Upstream:** HuggingFace model cards for
[`Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_5`](https://huggingface.co/Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_5)
and
[`Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_6`](https://huggingface.co/Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_6).

**Related papers:**
[2025 — Hollmann et al. — Accurate predictions on small data with a tabular foundation model](papers/2025_Hollmann_et_al._Accurate_predictions_on_small_data_with_a_tabular_foundation_model.pdf),
[2026 — Grinsztajn et al. — TabPFN-2.5](papers/2026_Grinsztajn_et_al._TabPFN_2.5_Advancing_the_State_of_the_Art_in_Tabular_Foundation_Models.pdf).

**What it is.** Concatenation of the public HuggingFace model-card
READMEs for `Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_5` and `Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_6` (the
source URLs are written out as comments inside the file). Each card
is included twice in the dump (with and without `# Source:` headers);
the content is identical and any grep against the file will still
hit.

**Why it matters here.** The model cards are the *primary published
source* for which checkpoint is real-finetuned vs. synthetic-only,
the layer counts (v2.5 = 18–24, v2.6 = 24), the licence terms, and
the citation. Every fact in
[`docs/CHECKPOINTS.md`](CHECKPOINTS.md) is
cross-checked against this file.

**Contents in detail.**

- **YAML front matter** — licence (`tabpfn-2.5-license-v1.1` /
  `tabpfn-2.6-license-v1.0`), pipeline tag, gated-access fields,
  thematic tags including `finance`.
- **Model overview** — TabPFN-2.x = transformer-based foundation
  model, in-context learning, single forward pass.
- **Architecture** — v2.5: "TabPFNv2-like alternating attention with
  18-24 layers"; v2.6: "TabPFNv2-like alternating attention with 24
  layers".
- **Training data and priors** —
  - v2.5: "TabPFN-2.5: trained purely on synthetic tabular tasks /
    Real-TabPFN-2.5: continued pre-training on real-world datasets
    (for details please see Appendix C.1 of the model tech report)."
  - v2.6: "TabPFN-2.6 is trained purely on synthetic tabular tasks."
    (No real-finetuned variant. Decisive evidence that v2.6 default
    *is* the synthetic-only base.)
- **The complete v2.5 checkpoint catalogue** with one-line
  descriptions per checkpoint, identical to what you'll find inside
  `TabPFN .txt:736-751`. The 🌍 emoji marks the real-finetuned
  variants. v2.6 has only the `_default` checkpoints listed.
- **Intended use / limitations** — ≤ 50,000 samples and ≤ 2,000
  features; not for unstructured data.
- **Licensing** — research-only with an enterprise option for
  commercial use.

**When to grep this file:** when you need a primary citation for any
checkpoint provenance claim (v2.5/v2.6, real vs synthetic, intended
sample/feature limits). For pipeline implementation, prefer
`TabPFN .txt` (more detailed) or `TabPFN Docs.txt` (more recent
prose).

## `NanoTabPFN.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/automl/nanoTabPFN](https://github.com/automl/nanoTabPFN).

**Related paper:**
[2025 — Pfefferle et al. — nanoTabPFN: A Lightweight and Educational Reimplementation of TabPFN](papers/2025_Pfefferle_et_al._nanoTabPFN_A_Lightweight_and_Educational_Reimplementation_of_TabPFN.pdf).

**What it is.** A minimal reference implementation of TabPFN — the
"how-it-works-in-under-1000-lines" educational version, trimmed of
the production package's ergonomics (sklearn API surface, ensembles,
distributed training, autocast handling, multiple checkpoints) so
that the *core training and inference loop* is visible at a glance.

**Why it's the highest-signal file in this folder for our work:**
Real-TabPFN's source is not public, so the closest thing we have to
"a continued-pretraining loop in a few hundred lines that we can
read end-to-end" lives here.

**Contents in detail:**

- **Lines ~150–260 — Data loading and preprocessing.** Defines
  `get_feature_preprocessor(X)` which fits a `ColumnTransformer` that
  separates numerical from categorical columns by checking, for each
  column, whether `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce').notna().sum()`
  equals the non-NaN count. Numerical columns get coerced to numeric
  arrays; categoricals get an `OrdinalEncoder(handle_unknown=
  'use_encoded_value', unknown_value=np.nan)`. Constant columns (≤ 1
  unique non-NaN value) are dropped. This is the *minimum* feature
  preprocessing TabPFN inputs need, and it matches the rules we are
  putting into `src/data/sanitize.py`.
- **`get_openml_datasets(...)`** — illustrates the OpenML download
  path for evaluation (TabArena task IDs hardcoded), with stratified
  subsampling via `train_test_split(stratify=y)`.
- **Lines ~520–700 — Model definition.** The full TabPFN-style
  alternating-attention transformer in pure PyTorch: alternating
  attention "between samples" and "between features" within the same
  layer, plus a target embedding head.
  `forward(src, train_test_split_index)` shows exactly how the
  context-vs-query split is consumed: the model sees one tensor of
  shape `(B, N, F)` and an integer index that says "rows
  [0:split_idx) are context with labels, rows [split_idx:] are query
  with masked labels".
- **Lines 758–832 — Training loop.** The pretraining loop in 70
  lines: `schedulefree.AdamWScheduleFree`, learning rate `4e-3`,
  cross-entropy loss reshaped to `(B*N_query, n_classes)`,
  gradient-norm clip at `1.0`, periodic eval. This is the structural
  reference for `src/train/train.py` once we get there.
- **Lines 835–880 — `PriorDumpDataLoader`.** Loads pre-baked
  synthetic prior datasets from an HDF5 file. Fields:
  `X (B, N_max, F_max)`, `y (B, N_max)`, `num_features`,
  `num_datapoints`, `single_eval_pos` (= train/test split index),
  `max_num_classes`. Padding-aware: each batch slices to the
  per-batch max feature count and max sequence length. **Reference
  format only** — since the 2026-05-20 refactor our training pipeline
  reads sanitized CSVs from `data/processed/` directly and assembles
  the same `(X_context, y_context, X_query, y_query)` quadruple on
  the fly inside `src/train/dataloader.py::_build_step_batch` (with
  a fresh random subsample every epoch). No `.npz` cache step.

**When to grep this file:** any time you need the "what does the
training loop actually look like" answer — model `forward`
semantics, loss shape, gradient handling, optimizer setup, batch
layout.

## `On Finetuning Tabular Foundation Models.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/yandex-research/tabpfn-finetuning](https://github.com/yandex-research/tabpfn-finetuning).

**Related paper:**
[2025 - Rubachev et al. - On Finetuning Tabular Foundation Models](papers/2025_Rubachev_et_al._On_Finetuning_Tabular_Foundation_Models_1.pdf).

**What it is.** A Yandex Research code dump for the Rubachev et al.
TabPFNv2 finetuning study. It is much larger than the Prior Labs
example scripts because it includes experiment grids, tuned configs,
result reports, RTDL-style data/model utilities, LoRA utilities, and
a vendored/modified TabPFN implementation.

**Why it matters here.** The paper's main practical conclusion is
that full finetuning is the strongest and simplest TabPFNv2
adaptation baseline: it converges quickly, tends to beat PEFT
variants, and can be run on datasets up to roughly 50K rows on an
80GB GPU. The mechanism result is also directly relevant to
CreditPFN: finetuning improves the alignment between test-row query
representations and in-context training-row key representations, so
attention weights better track target similarity. For our project,
this repo is the best public source for the LR grid, patience,
prediction length, and A100 memory assumptions behind single-dataset
gradient adaptation.

**Two facts that frame comparisons against it:** (1) the 342 archived
``report.json`` grid runs inspected below are full-FT runs, but the
**paper also reports LoRA and other partial/PEFT ablations**. Do not turn
the contents of that one result directory into a claim that the paper did
not evaluate LoRA. (2) each run adapts to one target table. Multi-dataset
corpus continued pretraining is Garg et al.'s Real-TabPFN setting and
CreditPFN's setting, not Rubachev's experimental design.

**Contents in detail:**

- **`README.md` around line 1862** - project overview, arXiv link
  (`2506.08982`), `uv` setup, checkpoint download instructions, and
  the headline finding: full finetuning is the practical default for
  TabPFNv2. The README BibTeX still says `arXiv:2024.08982`; treat
  the paper text and arXiv link (`2506.08982`, 2025) as canonical.
- **`pyproject.toml` around line 1946** - Python pinned to
  `==3.11.11`, with CUDA 12.4 extras and dependencies including
  PyTorch, CatBoost, XGBoost, Optuna, RTDL utilities, and `loralib`.
- **`exp/full-finetune/*/*.toml`** - reproducible experiment grids.
  The adult config at line 2212 calls
  `bin.tabpfnv2_finetune.main`, uses `n_trials = 10`, brute-force
  learning rates from about `5e-6` to `5e-4`, `batch_size = 1`,
  `epoch_size = 10`, `seq_len_pred = 1024`, and
  `finetune_mode = "full"`.
- **`report.json` / `summary.json` blocks** - practical run reports:
  A100-SXM4-80GB hardware, roughly 7.2M or 11.1M trainable
  parameters depending on the config, early-stopped best steps, and
  zero-shot vs. finetuned metrics.
- **`lib/data.py`** - expects arrays such as `X_num.npy`,
  `X_bin.npy`, `X_cat.npy`, `Y.npy`, and
  `split-default/{train,val,test}_idx.npy`. Useful when designing
  future adapters between our `.npz` cache and RTDL-style tabular
  loaders.
- **`lib/deep.py`** - RTDL numerical embedding utilities such as
  piecewise-linear embeddings, one-hot helpers, optimization helpers,
  and parameter-count utilities.
- **`lib/tabpfn/lora_utils.py` around line 85367** - LoRA injection
  helpers for TabPFN internals, including replacements for MHA,
  linear layers, and embeddings. This is the local reference if we
  later benchmark LoRA against full continued pretraining.
- **`lib/tabpfn/preprocessing.py` around line 85798** - vendored
  TabPFN preprocessing configs (`none`, `numeric`, `onehot`,
  `ordinal`, `ordinal_shuffled`, etc.) and the package-level feature
  preprocessing choices.

**Verified config facts (aggregated across all 342 `report.json`
runs, 2026-06-23) — and how CreditPFN deliberately differs.** These
are the *reference* values; our deviations are intentional and noted:

| Knob | Reference (all 342 runs) | CreditPFN | Why we differ |
|------|--------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| optimizer | AdamW | AdamW | match |
| **weight_decay** | **0.0** | **0.0** (was 0.01; fixed 2026-06-23) | match — decay-to-origin fights the prior |
| LR | tuned 5e-6…5e-4, median ~3.9e-5 | grid {3e-7, 1e-6, 1e-5, 3e-5} | low rung matches Garg; high rung approaches Rubachev's median |
| LR schedule | **none (constant)** | warmup→cosine | deliberate; consider a constant rung |
| **L2-SP / anchor** | **not used** | λ=0.003 (full-FT only) | follows Garg's Real-TabPFN corpus-CPT recipe, not Rubachev |
| batch_size | 1 | 1 | match |
| epoch policy | `n_epochs=-1` + early stop (patience 16) | fixed 50 epochs + divergence-abort | deliberate (val-noise with ~10 datasets) |
| ensemble/step | clf 2 / **reg 8** (official wrappers) | PD 2 / LGD 8 | match |
| loss | CE (clf) / bar-dist NLL (reg) | same | match |

The main optimization lesson from this repository is that Rubachev uses
`weight_decay=0.0`; stacking decay-to-origin on an L2-SP anchor would be a
separate, untested regularization choice. **This says nothing about Garg's
AdamW weight decay, which the Real-TabPFN paper does not report.** Garg
does explicitly use L2-SP λ=0.003, warmup→cosine, and LR 3e-7. Keep the
two papers separate. (The README body is unrecoverable from this dump — a
`charmap` codec error replaced it — so prose claims must be read from the
PDF, not this `.txt`.)

**Important caveat.** The dump references
`bin.tabpfnv2_finetune.main`, but this `.txt` snapshot contains no
`FILE: bin/...` sections. Use it as a high-signal reference for
configs, results, LoRA/vendored TabPFN changes, and paper-grounded
hyperparameters; do not assume the local dump is a complete runnable
clone.

**When to grep this file:** when choosing single-dataset finetuning
hyperparameters, comparing full finetuning vs. LoRA/prefix variants,
or checking how Rubachev et al. structure their data arrays, tuning
reports, and TabPFNv2 internals.

## `PFNS.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/SamuelGabriel/PFNs](https://github.com/SamuelGabriel/PFNs)
(formerly `automl/PFNs`; the old slug no longer resolves directly).

**Related papers:**
[2021 — Müller et al. — Transformers Can Do Bayesian Inference](papers/2021_Muller_et_al._Transformers_Can_Do_Bayesian_Inference.pdf)
(the foundational PFN framework that this code implements).

**What it is.** The full Prior-Labs `PFNs` repo — the underlying
"Prior-fitted Network" framework that TabPFN is built on top of.
Contains the canonical implementations of the *internal* encoder
steps that run inside every TabPFN forward pass.

**Why it matters here:** It tells us what `sanitize.py` should *not*
duplicate. The model already handles a lot of preprocessing
internally; if our pipeline does it a second time we either waste
work or (worse) double-transform features in ways that drift the
distribution off the model's training prior.

**Contents in detail:**

- **Lines ~5700–5800 — Encoder-step composition.** Shows how the
  standard TabPFN-2.x model assembles its input encoder as a
  sequence:
  - `NanHandlingEncoderStep` — handles missing values (emits an
    explicit indicator and replaces NaN with a learned default).
  - `LinearInputEncoderStep` — linear projection of features into
    embedding space.
  - `VariableNumFeaturesEncoderStep` — pads/shuffles the feature
    dimension so a model trained on F-max features can ingest any
    F ≤ F-max.
  - `ConstantNormalizationInputEncoderStep` and
    `InputNormalizationEncoderStep` — per-column normalisation
    fitted on the *context* rows only and applied to query rows.
- **Lines ~6048–6310 — Each encoder step's full implementation.**
  - `LinearInputEncoderStep` (line 6048).
  - `ConstantNormalizationInputEncoderStep` (6108).
  - `NanHandlingEncoderStep` (6143): replaces `NaN` with
    `nan_indicator`, `+inf` with `inf_indicator`, `-inf` with
    `neg_inf_indicator`, then concatenates a binary "was-this-NaN"
    flag along the feature dimension. Confirms that our sanitize
    step (h) — replace ±inf with NaN — is correct.
  - `VariableNumFeaturesEncoderStep` (6211).
  - `InputNormalizationEncoderStep` (6290) — per-column mean/std
    computed on the context split only.
- **Lines ~16335–16415 — Standalone preprocessing transforms** that
  run *before* the model, as ensemble members at inference time:
  `PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson')` /
  `PowerTransformer(method='box-cox')` /
  `QuantileTransformer(output_distribution='normal')` /
  `RobustScaler(unit_variance=True)`. **These are inference-time
  ensemble preprocessing, not training-time preprocessing.**

**When to grep this file:** to confirm whether something is the
model's internal job or our pipeline's job; to look up what the
encoder steps actually do to NaNs / infs / constants; to see the
canonical ensemble of preprocessing options at inference.

---

## `PFNs4BO.txt`

**Upstream:** Same repo as PFNs (BO branch /
[github.com/automl/PFNs4BO](https://github.com/automl/PFNs4BO)).

**Related paper:**
[2023 — Müller et al. — PFNs4BO: In-Context Learning for Bayesian Optimization](papers/2023_Muller_et_al._PFNs4BO_In_Context_Learning_for_Bayesian_Optimization.pdf).

**What it is.** PFNs adapted to Bayesian optimisation. Implements an
acquisition function on top of a PFN posterior — useful for
hyperparameter search but unrelated to credit-risk pretraining.

**When to grep this file:** only if you later want to use a PFN as
a surrogate model for tuning your own continued-pretraining
hyperparameters. No relevant preprocessing or training-loop
machinery beyond what's already in `PFNS.txt`.

---

## `TabDPT.txt`

[`layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training`](https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT-training)).

**Related paper:**
[2026 — Ma et al. — TabDPT: Scaling Tabular Foundation Models on Real Data](papers/2026_Ma_et_al._TabDPT_Scaling_Tabular_Foundation_Models_on_Real_Data.pdf).

**What it is.** TabDPT is the *real-data-only* counterpart to
TabPFN: a transformer trained on real tables sampled from OpenML
via retrieval-augmented self-supervision, with no synthetic
prior. The dump in this folder is the *inference* repo — load
weights from HuggingFace and predict on a new dataset via a
sklearn-style API.

**Why it matters.** TabDPT and TabPFN bracket the
synthetic-vs-real spectrum from opposite ends. Real-TabPFN (and
hence CreditPFN) sits in the middle. Having TabDPT locally lets
us include it as an *inference baseline* in the eval harness:
compare CreditPFN's scores against TabPFN-2.6, TabDPT, TabICL,
and the published Real-TabPFN-2.5 weights, all in one place.

**Contents in detail.**

* `src/tabdpt/classifier.py`, `regressor.py`, `estimator.py`,
  `model.py`, `utils.py` — the inference path.
* `tabdpt_datasets/openml.py` — OpenML dataset loaders that they
  used at training time and ship for reproducibility.
* `tabdpt_datasets/data_splits/{cls,reg}_datasets.csv` — the
  exact CSV manifest of which OpenML datasets they trained on.
  Useful for *contamination checking* — any dataset on this list
  must NOT appear in our held-out evaluation set if we want a
  fair comparison.
* `tests/cls_example.py`, `reg_example.py` — minimum working
  example.

**When to grep this file:** when implementing the TabDPT
baseline in `src/eval/`, or when checking that our credit-risk
held-out splits don't overlap with TabDPT's training corpus.

## `TabPFN .txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/PriorLabs/tabPFN](https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabPFN)
(the main `tabpfn` Python package).

**What it is.** The user-facing sklearn-style API
(`TabPFNClassifier`, `TabPFNRegressor`), the checkpoint-loading
infrastructure, the inference-time ensembling, and the documented
list of every released `.ckpt` and what it's good for. Plus the
finetuning wrappers (`FinetunedTabPFNClassifier` /
`FinetunedTabPFNRegressor`) and the multi-table machinery
(`get_preprocessed_dataset_chunks`,
`DatasetCollectionWithPreprocessing`, `fit_from_preprocessed`) that
our `src/train/` will compose on.

**Why it matters:** this is the single source of truth for
checkpoint provenance (which files are synthetic-only, which are
real-finetuned), the public configuration knobs
(`PreprocessorConfig`, `ModelInterfaceConfig`), and the supported
input shapes / dtypes / NaN handling at the API boundary.

**Contents in detail:**

- **Lines 649–650** — README block listing the *default* v2.5
  classifier and regressor checkpoint URLs.
- **Lines 736–751 — The complete TabPFN-2.5 checkpoint catalogue
  with one-line descriptions:** which is real-finetuned (🌍 emoji),
  which is synthetic, which specialises for "large features"
  (`large-features-L` up to 500 features, `large-features-XL` up
  to 1000), which for "large samples" (>30K), which for low-skew
  regression targets, etc. **This is what
  `docs/CHECKPOINTS.md` is built from — when in doubt, this
  section of `TabPFN .txt` is ground truth.**
- **Lines 2606–2628 — Programmatic checkpoint name registry** used
  inside the package to validate `model_path` arguments.
- **Lines 6952–6985 — `tabpfn-v2-` (v2.0) checkpoint registry** for
  the older v2.0 model family.
- **Lines 17301–17400 — `DatasetCollectionWithPreprocessing`**, the
  `torch.utils.data.Dataset` subclass that lazily preprocesses each
  dataset on `__getitem__`, returning a `ClassifierBatch` or
  `RegressorBatch`.
- **Lines 17702–17761 — `shuffle_and_chunk_data`**, TabPFN's own
  per-dataset row sub-sampler. Stratified for multiclass,
  non-stratified for regression. Reference behaviour: our
  `src/train/dataloader.py::_build_step_batch` performs the same
  shape (subsample → 80/20 ctx/qry split → ordinal-encode) on the
  fly per epoch, against the sanitized CSV directly.
- **Lines 17764–17881 — `get_preprocessed_dataset_chunks`**, the
  helper that accepts a *list* of datasets and produces a
  `DatasetCollectionWithPreprocessing` ready for a multi-table
  training loop.
- **Lines 18062, 18999, 19616 — `FinetunedTabPFNBase`,
  `FinetunedTabPFNClassifier`, `FinetunedTabPFNRegressor`** — the
  official sklearn-compatible finetuning wrappers.
- **`PreprocessorConfig` definitions** — exposes
  `name='none' | 'safepower' | 'quantile_uni_coarse' | 'quantile_uni'
  | 'robust_scaler' | …`. These are inference-time ensemble names.
- **`save_tabpfn_model` utility** (around line 710) — the reverse
  direction: how to dump a model object back to a `.ckpt`. PR #930
  (changelog ~line 435) fixed it to set
  `architecture_name="tabpfn_v3"` for v3 configs and to persist
  `inference_config_`, which is exactly the gap our own
  `save_finetuned` had to close (see the checkpoint-format note
  below).
- **Architecture registry** (`architectures/tabpfn_v2_6.py`,
  `tabpfn_v3.py`; `inference_config.py`) — the `architecture_name`
  strings the loader recognises and the `InferenceConfig` schema
  (pydantic, `extra="forbid"`).

**The 4-key checkpoint contract (critical for `src/train/model.py`).**
A TabPFN checkpoint is a single `torch.save` dict with exactly four
keys: `state_dict`, `config` (asdict of the pydantic
`ArchitectureConfig`), `architecture_name`, and `inference_config`
(asdict of `InferenceConfig`). Valid `architecture_name` values are
`tabpfn_v2`, `tabpfn_v2_5`, `tabpfn_v2_6`, `tabpfn_v3` (a missing key
defaults to `tabpfn_v2`; the legacy `"base"` string remaps to
`tabpfn_v2_5`). Our `save_finetuned` writes all four keys; the only
robustness gap is that the `architecture_name` fallback leans on the
private upstream symbol `_resolve_architecture_name` (hardened, and
`src/train/model.py` now RAISES rather than mislabelling an unknown
architecture as `"base"` — 2026-06-23 audit fix). The
`weights_only=False` load patch in `src/model/tabpfn_models.py` is
necessary because PyTorch ≥ 2.6 rejects the embedded pydantic config
objects by default.

**v2.6-vs-v3 criterion handling (regressors).** v3's
`model.forward` takes `test_targets_MB`, so the loader STRIPS the
`criterion.*` keys and rebuilds the bar-distribution from the model's
`regression_borders` buffer; v2.6 has no `test_targets_MB`, so the
loader REQUIRES the `criterion.*` keys. Our `save_finetuned` writes
`criterion.*` for regressors — required by v2.6, harmlessly stripped
by v3 — so a saved regressor checkpoint round-trips correctly for
both architectures.

**When to grep this file:** checkpoint names, the 4-key checkpoint
schema, public API surface, inference-time preprocessing names,
validation / error messages the package raises, the multi-table
finetuning machinery.

## `TabPFN Client.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-client](https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-client).

**Related paper:** none.

hosted API. Not relevant for our self-hosted pretraining workflow on
VSC.

## `TabPFN Docs.txt`

**Upstream:** [docs.priorlabs.ai/overview](https://docs.priorlabs.ai/overview).
Prior Labs **no longer publishes** the docs GitHub source, so this file
cannot be refreshed by ``src/utils/refresh_repositories.py``. It's
listed in ``SKIP_NON_GIT`` and must be refreshed by hand (copy the
relevant pages from the live docs site) when the on-disk snapshot
goes stale.

**Related papers:** indirectly all of the TabPFN papers — the docs
sit on top of the package described above.

**What it is.** Flat dump of the TabPFN documentation repository —
the Markdown sources that the docs.priorlabs.ai site is built from.
~7,800 lines covering every documented capability, hyperparameter,
integration, and fine-tuning recipe.

**Why it's the highest-signal recent addition:** it contains the
*official* documentation of TabPFN's preprocessing knobs, the
fine-tuning wrappers shipped inside the package, and the design
intent behind every configurable parameter. For Stage 1–4 design,
this is the most authoritative non-code reference.

**Contents in detail (with line numbers worth bookmarking):**

- **`overview.mdx`** (around lines 50–200) — what TabPFN is and what
  its capabilities are.
- **`models.mdx`** (around lines 1100–1180) — version comparison
  table.
- **`improving-performance/preprocessing.mdx`** (lines 6331–6404) —
  **most important section for our Stage 3 (`sanitize.py`)
  design.** Documents:
  - `PREPROCESS_TRANSFORMS`: ensemble preprocessing names
    (`"quantile_uni"`, `"squashing_scaler_default"`, `"safepower"`,
    `"quantile_uni_coarse"`, `"kdi"`, `"robust"`, `"none"`).
  - `categorical_name`: encoding options.
  - `max_features_per_estimator`: default `500`.
  - `REGRESSION_Y_PREPROCESS_TRANSFORMS`: target transforms for
    regression (`"none"`, `"safepower"`, `"quantile_norm"`,
    `"quantile_uni"`, `"1_plus_log"`).
  - `OUTLIER_REMOVAL_STD`: **default `"auto"` which resolves to
    `12.0` for classification and `None` for regression** — see the
    "Outlier handling" section below.
  - `POLYNOMIAL_FEATURES`, `FINGERPRINT_FEATURE`,
    `SUBSAMPLE_SAMPLES`. None of these belong in
    `config/data.yaml` — they are inference-time levers.
- **`capabilities/fine-tuning.mdx`** (lines 4224–4450) —
  documentation of the official `FinetunedTabPFNClassifier` and
  `FinetunedTabPFNRegressor` wrappers. Important caveat at line
  4246: "The fine-tuning process decouples the preprocessing
  pipeline to generate transformed tensors that mirror the
  preprocessing configurations used during inference, ensuring the
  model optimizes on the exact same data variations it encounters
  when making predictions."
- **`improving-performance/feature-engineering.mdx`,
  `feature-selection.mdx`, `model-parameters.mdx`** — softmax
  temperature, balanced-probability handling, imbalance handling.
- **`extensions/*.mdx`** — `hpo`, `many-class`, `post-hoc-ensembles`,
  `rf-pfn`. Reference for the evaluation protocol later.
- **`api-reference/*.mdx`** — hosted-API only.
- **`integrations/*.mdx`** — Databricks, Azure Foundry, SageMaker,
  MLflow, n8n.
- **`use-cases/*.mdx`** — including `finance.mdx`.

**When to grep this file:** for the *intent* and *contract* of any
documented TabPFN configuration option. Faster than grepping
`TabPFN .txt` (which is the implementation) when you just need
"what does this parameter do".

## `TabPFN Drift-Resilient.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/automl/Drift-Resilient_TabPFN](https://github.com/automl/Drift-Resilient_TabPFN).

**Related paper:**
[2024 — Helli et al. — Drift-Resilient TabPFN](papers/2024_Helli_et_al._Drift_Resilient_TabPFN_In_Context_Learning_Temporal_Distribution_Shifts_on_Tabular_Data_1.pdf).

**What it is.** A research repo that fine-tunes / specialises TabPFN
for distribution-shift robustness — explicitly modelling "training
distribution drifts at inference time" rather than assuming i.i.d.

**Why it's interesting for credit risk specifically:** credit-risk
data is *defined* by macroeconomic regime drift. PD and LGD
distributions shift dramatically between expansion and recession.
A model that's been continued-pretrained on a credit-risk corpus
might benefit from drift-aware training-time augmentations
borrowed from this repo. Not a Stage 1–4 concern, but worth
grepping during the training-loop design.

**Contents in detail:** drift-aware loss formulations,
distribution-shift simulation as a training-time augmentation,
extra evaluation protocols (eval on artificially shifted test
sets).

**When to grep this file:** when designing training-time
augmentations or evaluation under regime shift.

## `TabPFN Extensions.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-extensions](https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-extensions).

**Related paper:** none directly; references the `AutoTabPFN`
ensemble idea documented across multiple TabPFN papers.

**What it is.** `tabpfn-extensions` — official add-on package
(post-hoc ensembling, RF-PFN hybrids, embeddings, hyperparameter
search via OpenAutoML, a "many-class classifier" wrapper for >10
target classes, a fingerprint-feature tool, etc.).

**Why it's relevant:** at evaluation time, the standard reporting
package compares plain TabPFN vs. `AutoTabPFN` (post-hoc ensemble).
We will probably compare *our* CreditPFN against both, so the
ensemble mechanics matter for fair comparison.

**Contents in detail:** post-hoc ensemble definition (uses
AutoGluon under the hood), RF-PFN tree-based hybrid (`rf_pfn`
extension — good baseline since classical PD/LGD modelling
traditionally uses gradient-boosted trees and random forests).

**When to grep this file:** when designing the evaluation protocol
or building strong baselines.

## `TabPFN V2 Finetuning.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN/tree/main/examples](https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN/tree/main/examples)
(the `finetune_classifier.py` and `finetune_regressor.py`
example scripts).

**Related paper:**
[2025 — Rubachev et al. — On Finetuning Tabular Foundation Models](papers/2025_Rubachev_et_al._On_Finetuning_Tabular_Foundation_Models_1.pdf).

**What it is.** Sebastian Pineda's TabPFN-V2-Finetuning recipe — the
closest public analog of Real-TabPFN's continued-pretraining, but
with one key difference: this is dataset-specific finetuning
("finetune TabPFN-v2 to *one* downstream dataset") rather than
continued pretraining on a whole corpus.

**Why it's a critical reference:** it shows the exact mechanics of
loading a v2 checkpoint, making a forward/backward pass through it,
and saving the result — which is the unit-of-work for continued
pretraining too. Just call the same loop in a sweep over many
datasets.

**Official wrapper defaults (verified, lines 183–188 / 339–348).**
These are the upstream `FinetunedTabPFN*` settings our `train.yaml`
grid is calibrated against:

| Wrapper | epochs | lr | `n_estimators_finetune` | ctx+query samples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FinetunedTabPFNClassifier` | 30 | `2e-5` | 2 | — |
| `FinetunedTabPFNRegressor` | 30 | `1e-5` | 8 | `n_finetune_ctx_plus_query_samples = 20_000` |

CreditPFN uses `n_estimators_finetune = 2` on **both** tracks (the
reference regressor uses 8 — a candidate to revisit for LGD) and a
fixed-50-epoch schedule with divergence-abort instead of the 30-epoch
default.

**Contents in detail:**

- **Lines ~85, 367, 418, 718** — `save_path_to_fine_tuned_model =
  "./fine_tuned_model.ckpt"` and surrounding
  `torch.save({"state_dict": …, "optimizer_state": …,
  "scheduler_state": …}, path)`. Note this is a *training-state*
  save (weights + optimizer + scheduler, for resuming a run); it is
  **not** the 4-key inference checkpoint (`state_dict`, `config`,
  `architecture_name`, `inference_config`) that the package loader
  consumes and that our `save_finetuned` writes — see the
  `TabPFN .txt` section for that contract.
- **Lines ~407–441** — `from tabpfn.config import
  ModelInterfaceConfig, PreprocessorConfig` and the
  `no_preprocessing_inference_config` pattern.
- **Lines 468, 562** — `OrdinalEncoder(handle_unknown=
  'use_encoded_value', unknown_value=-1)`. Confirms the categorical
  encoding contract.
- **Lines 538–700** — `preprocess_dummy_data(...)` end-to-end:
  load OpenML task → split → fit OrdinalEncoder on train →
  transform query → cast to torch tensors → device placement.
- **Loss / backward / optimizer setup** (search for
  `loss.backward`).

**When to grep this file:** for the canonical "load checkpoint →
attach optimizer → forward pass → backward pass → save checkpoint"
sequence for *real* TabPFN-2 weights, not the toy model.

## `TabPFN Wide.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/not-a-feature/TabPFN-Wide](https://github.com/not-a-feature/TabPFN-Wide)
(the canonical repo for the TabPFN-Wide paper, Kolberg et al. 2026).

**Related paper:**
[2026 — Kolberg et al. — TabPFN-Wide](papers/2026_Kolberg_et_al._TabPFN_Wide_Continued_Pre_Training_for_Extreme_Feature_Counts.pdf).

**What it is.** TabPFN-Wide — modifications for high-dimensional
inputs, e.g. multi-omics or wide credit-bureau datasets with
hundreds to thousands of columns.

**Why it matters:** several credit datasets in our raw corpus
already have >100 columns, so we need a story for wide data.
TabPFN-Wide's answer is the **opposite** of ours: instead of
reducing features, it *widens the synthetic prior* so the model
natively handles hundreds-to-thousands of columns, and it uses
`FeatureAgglomeration` only as a **baseline it compares against**,
not as its method. Our `sanitize.py` step is unsupervised feature
*selection* (keep real columns) — an independent, pragmatic cap;
useful to read this repo for how the widening alternative works,
**not** as the source of our design.

**Contents in detail:**

- **Lines ~170–890 — Multiple `load_state_dict` patterns** for
  loading both the standard TabPFN checkpoint and Wide-modified
  checkpoints.
- **Lines 1746–1801 — `load_checkpoint(self)` method** showing how
  the Wide trainer loads a *training-state* checkpoint
  (state_dict + optimizer state + scheduler state). Template for
  resumable training in our SLURM jobs.
- **Lines 2244, 2294, 2312 — `FeatureAgglomeration` usage.** Two
  variants: `FeatureAgglomeration(n_clusters=n_features)` (default
  Euclidean+Ward) at line 2294, and `FeatureAgglomeration(
  n_clusters=n_features, metric='precomputed', linkage='complete')`
  at line 2312. **Confirms the idiom we adopt for sanitize step
  (i).**

**When to grep this file:** dimensionality-reduction strategies,
checkpoint resumption, anything wide/high-feature.

## `TabTune.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune](https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune).

**Related paper:**
[arXiv:2511.02802 — Lexsi-Labs 2025 — TabTune: A Unified Library for
Inference and Fine-Tuning of Tabular Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02802).

**What it is.** A unified, sklearn-style wrapper that exposes ~10
recent tabular foundation models — TabPFN-v2 / -v2.6, TabICL,
TabICLv2, OrionMSP v1.0 / v1.5, OrionBix, Mitra, ContextTab, TabDPT,
LimiX — under a single `TabularPipeline.fit() / .predict() /
.evaluate() / .save() / .load()` API. Built on three components:
`DataProcessor` (model-aware preprocessing), `TuningManager`
(per-model training strategy), `TabularPipeline` (end-to-end driver),
plus a `TabularLeaderboard` for head-to-head comparison. Each model
gets four tuning strategies: zero-shot inference, episodic
meta-learning FT (the *standard* way to finetune ICL models),
supervised FT, and PEFT/LoRA. Recent additions: 6-strategy ensembling
(`TabularEnsemble`), distillation (`TabDistiller` — TFM → MLP /
LightGBM / XGBoost / CatBoost), and TabPFNv2.6 native FT (the
official Prior Labs `FinetunedTabPFN*` API, surfaced through TabTune's
unified pipeline).

**Should we use TabTune?** **No, not for the training stage; possibly
for the eval stage in the future.** Reasoning:

1. *Training stage doesn't fit.* Real-TabPFN-style continued
   pretraining iterates one transformer over a *corpus* of datasets
   — an outer loop over many parents, each contributing context/
   query batches. TabTune's pipelines are *per-dataset*: one
   `TabularPipeline.fit()` call ↔ one dataset. Adopting TabTune for
   training would replace our cross-dataset loop with a series of
   per-dataset finetunes, which is a different research question.
   Our `src/train/loop.py` already implements the cross-dataset
   variant — reading sanitized CSVs directly via
   `ProcessedDatasetLoader` and drawing a fresh random subsample
   per epoch; no change needed.

2. *Eval stage is potentially attractive.* The user's plan compares
   TabPFN variants against XGBoost/CatBoost/LogReg/LinReg. TabTune
   would give us the option to *also* compare against TabICL,
   OrionMSP, Mitra, ContextTab, TabDPT, and LimiX with a single
   library — much cheaper than wrapping each one ourselves. The
   `TabularLeaderboard` API in particular looks like a near-drop-in
   alternative to our `src/eval/benchmark.py`.

3. *Cost.* TabTune pulls in every model's runtime as a dependency —
   torch, transformers, several specific repo wheels. That's a
   non-trivial install footprint on VSC. Worth doing only if the
   thesis / paper actually compares against ≥ 3 of the non-TabPFN
   foundation models.

**Recommendation:** keep TabTune in the repo for reference, do not
adopt it now. Revisit when the eval baseline list grows beyond
{XGBoost, CatBoost, LogReg/LinReg, TabPFN-untuned, TabPFN-trained}.
Specifically: if we add TabICL or any non-TabPFN foundation model as
a comparison, swap our hand-written wrapper for TabTune at that point
rather than building the 4th wrapper from scratch.

**When to grep this file:** when designing a new eval baseline that
would otherwise need its own model-specific wrapper. The
`TuningManager` and `DataProcessor` source code in particular shows
how each non-TabPFN model expects its inputs preprocessed
(integer-encoded categoricals for TabPFN vs. text-tokenised columns
for ContextTab vs. column-attention masks for TabICL, …).

posterior inference for a particular Bayesian prior, by sampling
synthetic datasets from that prior and training the model to map
context → query predictions.

## `VSC Documentation.txt`

**Upstream:** [github.com/hpcleuven/VscDocumentation](https://github.com/hpcleuven/VscDocumentation)
(the source of the [VSC documentation site](https://docs.vscentrum.be)).

**Related paper:** none — this is supercomputer infrastructure
documentation, not a research artefact.

**What it is.** Flat dump of the entire Sphinx-generated VSC
(Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum / Flemish Supercomputer Centre)
user documentation. ~39,000 lines of `.rst` source covering
account management, SSH/MFA setup, **Genius / wICE / Mindwell**
cluster hardware, SLURM job scripting, storage tiers, scientific
software modules, and the various ways to acknowledge the VSC.

**Why it matters here.** Continued pretraining runs on the **Mindwell
B200** cluster; data prep and eval run on **wICE**. When writing the
SLURM scripts under `scripts/slurm/` — partitions, GPU allocation,
walltimes, the Lustre/GPFS storage split — this dump is the canonical
reference. Verified facts (line numbers as of the 2026-06-23 dump):

* **Mindwell** (lines 37570–37642): partition `gpu_b200`, 3 nodes × 8
  = **24 B200 GPUs**, **192 GiB** VRAM each, AMD EPYC Turin hosts; max
  **24 cores + ~190 GiB CPU mem per GPU**. Account `lp_mindwell_pilot`
  (free pilot). `--clusters=mindwell`. GPFS scratch.
* **wICE** (lines 37959–38084): `gpu_h100` (5×4 = 20 H100, 80 GiB,
  16 cores/GPU) and `gpu_a100` (4×4 = 16 A100, 80 GiB, 18 cores/GPU).
  Lustre scratch. CPU `batch` partition for data prep.
* **Storage** (lines 37357–37873): `$VSC_HOME` 3 GiB / `$VSC_DATA`
  75 GiB (both NFS, backed up, all-cluster) / `$VSC_SCRATCH` 500 GiB
  (Lustre on wICE+Genius, GPFS on Mindwell; **purged after 30 days** —
  and `mv`/`rsync -a` don't refresh atime, so stage with `cp`).
  **Project ("staging") storage** lives under `$VSC_PROJECT_LUSTRE1`
  (`stg_XXXXX`, Lustre) and `$VSC_PROJECT_GPFS1` (Mindwell, GPFS) —
  single-copy, not guaranteed backed up. **Hard rule:** Mindwell jobs
  must use GPFS, wICE/Genius jobs must use Lustre for *sustained* I/O.
* **Scheduling** (lines 13343–14243, 35463–35563): `--clusters=` is
  mandatory; GPU walltime caps at **72 h** (no `gpu_*_long`); shorter
  walltime ⇒ better backfill priority; `sam-balance -A <acct>` checks
  credits (B200 437.5 / H100 569.4 / A100 141.7 per GPU-min).
* **Cross-cluster:** `--dependency` (afterok) across `-M` clusters is
  **undocumented/unverified** — we treat it as unsupported and submit
  data (wICE) / train (Mindwell) / eval (wICE) independently, sequenced
  through the shared staging tier.

## `TabPFN V2 Finetuning.txt` ↔ `On Finetuning Tabular Foundation Models.txt` ↔ `NanoTabPFN.txt` ↔ `TabPFN Wide.txt` — how they relate

| | NanoTabPFN | Wide | V2 Finetuning | On Finetuning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model definition | toy reimpl | full + wide modifications | uses real package | vendored/modified package |
| Loads real `.ckpt`? | no (trains from scratch) | yes | yes | yes |
| Has training loop? | yes (synthetic prior) | yes (sweep over real datasets) | yes (single-dataset finetune) | configs/results for single-dataset finetune |
| Closest to *our* use case | training-loop structure | dataset-sweep structure | checkpoint mechanics | hyperparameters + PEFT/full-finetune evidence |

We will end up combining all four: V2-Finetuning's checkpoint
loading + On-Finetuning's hyperparameter evidence + Wide's
resumable training-state pattern + NanoTabPFN's clear training-loop
scaffolding, applied to a multi-dataset corpus in the Real-TabPFN
spirit.

### Outlier handling: what TabPFN actually does (verified)

This is important enough to factor out into its own subsection,
because it directly determines how `sanitize.py` should treat
extreme values. The implementation lives in
`TabPFN .txt:15795-15828` (function `remove_outliers`) and
`TabPFN .txt:6273-6314` (the public knob `OUTLIER_REMOVAL_STD`).

```python
# TabPFN .txt:6273-6274
_REGRESSION_DEFAULT_OUTLIER_REMOVAL_STD: float | None = None
_CLASSIFICATION_DEFAULT_OUTLIER_REMOVAL_STD: float = 12.0
```

```python
# TabPFN .txt:15795 (paraphrased)
def remove_outliers(X, n_sigma=4, normalize_positions=-1, ...):
    # 1. Compute per-column mean/std using ONLY the context split.
    # 2. Mark cells outside [mean ± n_sigma·std] as NaN.
    # 3. Re-compute mean/std from the now-cleaned data.
    # 4. Re-derive the [lower, upper] bounds from those robust stats.
    # 5. Apply a SOFT log-squash (not hard clip):
    X = max(-log(1+|X|) + lower, X)
    X = min( log(1+|X|) + upper, X)
```

**Three takeaways for our pipeline:**

1. **TabPFN's z-score normalization is *not* a substitute for
   outlier handling.** Z-scoring is sensitive to the very outliers
   it's trying to normalise — a single `1e9` value pins the mean
   and std to `~1e9` and crushes everything else to ~0. That's why
   the package itself ships an outlier removal step *before* /
   *alongside* the normalization step.
2. **The default threshold is `12σ` for classification, and outlier
   removal is *disabled* by default for regression.** A `[0.5%,
   99.5%]` quantile cut would be ~ `±2.6σ` for Gaussians, which is
   far more aggressive than what TabPFN does at inference and would
   create a train-vs-inference distribution mismatch.
3. **`OUTLIER_REMOVAL_STD` is an *inference-time* parameter** — when
   we pretrain by feeding tensors directly to the underlying torch
   model, this step is not automatically applied for us. Our
   `sanitize.py` therefore only normalises `±inf → NaN`; we delegate
   true outlier handling to the package's own machinery at inference
   time.

### Fine-tuning wrappers: official package machinery

Independent of the data pipeline, `TabPFN Docs.txt:4224-4450` and
`TabPFN .txt:2035-2188` document `FinetunedTabPFNClassifier` /
`FinetunedTabPFNRegressor`. These are the supported entry points
for gradient-based adaptation of TabPFN. Our `src/train/loop.py`
goes one level lower than these wrappers: it calls the underlying
`PerFeatureTransformer.forward(x, y, ...)` directly with batches
assembled on the fly by `ProcessedDatasetLoader`, which lets us
iterate over a *corpus* of datasets (Real-TabPFN-style) rather
than fine-tune on one dataset at a time. Our per-epoch subsample
size is set in `config/data.yaml` (in the consuming project)
(`finetuning.max_rows_per_epoch`: **20000** for v3/default, **9000**
for v2.6), in the same spirit as the upstream
`FinetunedTabPFNClassifier` per-fit row cap.

## Refreshing this folder

- For the upstream code repos (`TabPFN .txt`, `PFNS.txt`, etc.),
  re-grab a fresh dump from GitHub (e.g. via `code2txt` or a manual
  concat of `find . -name "*.py" -exec cat {}`) and **overwrite the
  existing file with the same filename** so existing greps in the
  codebase keep resolving.
- For the docs and HuggingFace cards, refresh
  `TabPFN Docs.txt` and `Huggingface TabPFN.txt` manually from
  their upstream sources.
